# ImgToXLSX
Simple script to recreate an input image on a .xlsx file.

The script is really simple, basically it takes an image file as an input, handles its RGB data to HEX colors and create a .XLSX file 
that uses the HEX colors data to fill the background colors of the cells to recreate the image
